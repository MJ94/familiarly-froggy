 ## Instructions
 * In this game, there are bugs (the automated enemies that each move at different speeds) and a man (the user controllable player).
 * The goal of the game is to move the player from his starting point to the water without letting any of the enemies touch him.
 * You can move the player up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys to avoid the enemies.
 * If your player does collide with a bug, he will be sent back to his starting position.
 * If your player makes it to the water, a modal will appear, congratulating you and offering the chance to replay.
